In implementing the function using both prescriptive and functional programming, I found that the prescriptive style was more easy to debug since it was more straightforward in terms of explicitly defining the control flow, which made it intuitive for small tasks. However, I can see that it can be harder to maintain and extend for larger, more complex applications. Functional programming makes the code more concise and scalable. Ultimately, I do think that functional programming is better for its cleaner syntax and scalability, especially when dealing with complex data transformations.
